                    My name is Alex Bardsley. I am so grateful to have your student in seminary. My wife Sarah and I met in 2014 and were married in the Salt Lake Temple May 29th, 2015. Our two sons are Benson and Owen. I have come to learn for myself that God lives. Jesus is the Christ. He is my Savior and Redeemer. "We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins 2 Nephi 25:26."

                <h1>Lesson:1 Nephi 8 Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life</h1>

                <p class="par_exp">
                Lehi's dream is all about a father who is trying to reach two of his wayward sons. President Boyd K. Packer taught the following: “You may think that Lehi’s dream or vision has no special meaning for you, but it does. You are in it; all of us are in it.” ~President Boyd K. Packer (Jan. 16th, ’07) As you search 1 Nephi chapter 8, I invite you to look for where you are in Lehi's dream. Try to imagine yourself as a loving parent whose son or daughter has lost their way. What truths do you discover that could help you reach out to those that are lost?

                    All students are expected to have a physical set of scriptures in class. Please encourage your student to study their scriptures on their own at least ten minutes a day. Please encourage students to study from the Book of Mormon as that is our book of emphasis for spring 2020 semester.

                    Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Life finds a way. You really think you can fly that thing? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
